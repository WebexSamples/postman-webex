    "description": "Hey there! Thanks for checking out Spark for Developers. If you've used Spark you know how easy it makes staying in sync with your team and customers.\r\n\r\nIn Spark, conversations take place in virtual meeting rooms. Some rooms live for a few hours while others become permanent fixtures of your team's workflow with titles like Daily Standup or Build Status. Spark allows conversations to flow seamlessly between messages, video calls and real-time whiteboarding sessions. No other solution brings together so many facets of collaboration into a single unified platform.\r\n\r\nAnd it's that platform part that Spark for Developers is all about. We've taken a huge step towards opening up the power behind the Spark app to anyone seeking to extend the Spark experience.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.ciscospark.com/getting-started.html",
